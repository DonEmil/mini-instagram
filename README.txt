Instructions:

 - This project requires the XAMPP stack in order to run. Please install:
  	- MySQL, PHP, Apache webserver

 - Place the "mini-instagram" folder under the "htdocs" folder under "xamppfiles"
 - Place the "mysqli_connect.php" file next to "mini-instagram", under the "htdocs" folder.

Start the webserver, and the website will be available at localhost/mini-instagram, but it will not work without a database.

 - Create a new database called "instagram"
 - Import the database from instagram.sql

The database will now work as well, and the website can be used in full.
